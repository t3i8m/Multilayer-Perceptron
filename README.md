# Multilayer Perceptron for Handwritten Digit Recognition
Inspired by Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen.(http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

## Overview
This project implements one of the neuronal networks â€“  **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for **handwritten digit recognition**, based on concepts from Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* ```numpy``` (for numerical computations)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/t3i8m/Multilayer-Perceptron.git
cd Multilayer-Perceptron
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy 
```

## Usage
Run the program using main.py:
```sh
python main.py
```
## Dataset
This project uses the **MNIST dataset**, a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Each image is **28x28** pixels in grayscale.
